This directory is where the files for veewee and vagrant are installed. This is
in place to provide for deployment testing and development of Chef recipes.

## Step by step, should work(tm) instructions:
 1. Install any required gems (e.g. vagrant)
    gem install vagrant veewee
 2. Create ISO directory (I have mine in ~/ISO), and link
    mkdir ~/ISO
    ln -s ~/ISO 
 3. Populate ISO directory with Ubuntu ISO from [1] (or a mirror close to you)
    cd ~/ISO && wget http://bit.ly/Li7mIu 
 4. Review the process of generating a 'basebox' at [2]; then, do it
    vagrant basebox define mongodb-node 'ubuntu-11.10-server-amd64'
 5. Modify definitions/mongodb-node/postinstall.sh to ensure that the URLs are
    correct for Ruby and VBoxGuestAdditions
 7. Build the mongodb-node VM: 
    vagrant basebox build mongodb-node
    (this takes 35 minutes on my MBP/4G; have a snack or review [3])
 8. Use BDD to test the VM: 
    vagrant basebox validate mongodb-node
 9. Export the VM to vagrant "box" format
    vagrant basebox export mongodb-node
10. Add the "box" file to your vagrant library
    vagrant box add 'mongodb-node' 'mongodb-node.box'
11. Start mongodb-node VM
    vagrant up
12. You can ssh in and look around: 
    vagrant ssh
    (user: vagrant; pass: vagrant)

## Workflow - ymmv:
1. Take a snapshot
   vagrant snap take -n pre-feature -d 'before starting my feature'
2. Make some changes
3. Rollback to test from a good known state (when necessary)
   vagrant snap back
4. Test provisioning
   vagrant provision

## Tips
 * Write Vagrant output to a log file
    VAGRANT_LOG=provision.log vagrant provision
